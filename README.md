IKEA2 – EcoLens: Sustainability Advisor for Furniture with AI

Background & Context
Sustainability is no longer a niche concern — it is becoming the default
expectation in Europe. Young generations, in particular, want their homes to
reflect not only their taste, but also their values. They want to know: Where does
this furniture come from? What is it made of? What is its climate footprint?
Today, however, sustainability data is either buried in technical reports or
missing altogether. Shoppers rarely have the tools to compare alternatives, and
most purchasing decisions are still driven by price and style. This creates a gap:
consumers want to make greener choices, but lack the transparency and guidance
to do so.

AI can act as a sustainability translator. By aggregating material data,
production origins, and transport distances, AI can generate a simple, intuitive
sustainability score. Instead of overwhelming customers with technical jargon,
the system could visualize items as Green / Amber / Red, highlight trade-offs, and
recommend greener alternatives without sacrificing design or budget.
This creates value for both consumers and retailers: customers feel empowered
and aligned with their values, while brands strengthen their sustainability
credentials and future-proof their offerings.
